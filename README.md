This project contains various Go Lang implementation I have been undertaking. It involves 3 types of Go Programs under 'src' folder:

1) Coding exercises (ce), more suitable for anyone to learn about the language. These are smaller / tiny in scope. As I learn specific Go Lang concepts, I will continue to add the programs for educational purposes.

2) Some relatively moderate size implementation of well know algorithms and problems. Binary Tree (bt) is one such project which contains core Binary Tree implementation, Binary Search Tree implementation, and AVL Balanced Binary Search Tree implementation.

3) Finally, there will be bit ambitious projects which others may find useful or consume. Typically I intend to keep this production level ready. One such project started is 'smi' which will contain Go implementation for 'publishing/pushing content to Social Media simultaneously'. The first such proposed feature is a server implementation that will push POST content to Facebook and Twitter. It is still in 'development'and I will update the README when a first usable version is ready.

All of the content I intend to keep it free for anyone's use.

Under the 'cfg' folder, you will find configuration file templates for all of Go Lang programs under the 'src' folder. You would take these template files and create actual config files, with your corresponding run-time properties, to utilize the code.


Feel free to reach out to me (umesh409@yahoo.com) for:

- how to use the code mentioned here, or
- if you need any additional functionality in the current code. I will try my best to have it included.

Have a look and enjoy! 

Thanks for visiting!!!
