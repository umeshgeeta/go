This repository contains various go coding programs I have undertaken which I am free to share to with everyone. Here is the explanation of the content:

1) cfg folder contains various configuration files used in many programs. Typically, configuration files checked in here are templates and users are expected to fill in correct settings as applicable to their test / validation environment.

2) Under src folder subfolder ce contains standalone Coding exercises (ce). Anyone who wants to learn about the language and initial coding in Go Lang, would find those more relevant. These are smaller / tiny in scope. As I learn specific Go Lang concepts, I will continue to add the programs for educational purposes.

2) Some relatively moderate size implementation of well know algorithms and problems. Binary Tree (bt) is one such project which contains core Binary Tree implementation, Binary Search Tree implementation, and AVL Balanced Binary Search Tree implementation. It is under 'src/bt' with bt-main as it's test driver main program.

3) The folder 'src/smi' contains basic HTTPS client-server (and works via browser to server as well) skeleton implementation. How to log-in to Facebook that is implemented in this example. (More ambitious code sharing under this umbrella will have to wait as I work through 'ownership' issues.)

4) Typically projects under 'src' are non=module while folders at the level of 'src' will be Go Module (except cfg and test) like for exanple 'util'.

Feel free to reach out to me (umesh409@yahoo.com) for:

- how to use the code mentioned here, or
- if you need any additional functionality in the current code. I will try my best to have it included.

Code is under MIT License, so it is least restrictive. (Please stick to 'master' branch which has working code while code in 'dev' branch is still under development and not ready for consumption.)

Have a look and enjoy! 

Thanks for visiting!!!
