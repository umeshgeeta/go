The Universal Recipient

You're conducting a blood donation experiment with n people labeled from 1 to n. Your job is to find if any of the test subjects is an universal recipient.

The universal recipient only exists if:

1) The universal recipient can't donate to nobody
2) Everybody (except for the universal recipient itself) can donate to the universal recipient.
3) There's never more than 1 universal recipient amongst the test subjects.

You are given an array `donators` where donators[i] = [ai, bi] representing that the person labeled ai can donate to the person labeled bi. If a relationship does not exist in `donators` array, then such a donation relationship does not exist.

Write a function that returns the label of the universal recipient if the universal recipient exists, or return -1 otherwise.

Example 1:

Input: 
n = 2, donators = [[1,2]]
Output:
2

Example 2:

Input: 
n = 3, donators = [[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: 
3

Example 3:

Input: 
n = 3, donators = [[1,3],[2,3],[3,1]]
Output:
 -1
